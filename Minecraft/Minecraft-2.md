<h1>Are you new to Minecraft and don’t know where to start?</h1>
 Don’t worry, this guide will help you survive your first day and night in this amazing sandbox game. You will learn how to gather resources, craft tools, and more. Let’s get started!

(This article uses Java Edition. for step 2 in Bedrock Edition, go to Play and create a new world, rather than pressing "single-player.")

**Step 1: Choose your game mode**

Minecraft has different game modes that affect how you play. The most common ones are:

Survival mode: You have to gather materials, craft items, gain experience, and fight enemies. You also have a health bar and a hunger bar that you need to keep up. If you die, you lose your items and respawn at your spawn point.
Creative mode: You have unlimited resources and can build anything you want. You don’t have to worry about enemies, health, or hunger. You can also fly around the world freely.
For this guide, we will use survival mode as it is more challenging and fun.

**Step 2: Start a new world**

To start a new world, go to the main menu and click on “Singleplayer”. Then click on “Create New World”. You can name your world whatever you want and choose some options like difficulty, world type, cheats, etc. For now, just leave everything as default and click on “Create New World”.

**Step 3: Gather wood**

You will spawn in a random location in your world. The first thing you need to do is to gather some wood. Wood is essential for making tools and other items. To get wood, just punch a tree with your fist until it breaks. You will get some wood blocks that you can put in your inventory by pressing E.

**Step 4: Craft a crafting table**

Now that you have some wood, you need to make a crafting table. A crafting table allows you to make more complex items that require a 3x3 grid. To make a crafting table, open your inventory by pressing E and place four wood blocks in the 2x2 grid on the top right corner. You will get a crafting table that you can place in your hotbar by dragging it with your mouse.

**Step 5: Place your crafting table**

To use your crafting table, you need to place it on the ground. To do that, select it in your hotbar by scrolling with your mouse wheel or pressing the number keys. Then right-click on a flat surface where you want to place it. You can now use it by right-clicking on it again.

**Step 6: Craft some tools**

Using your crafting table, you can make some basic tools that will help you gather more resources and defend yourself. The most important tools are:

A wooden pickaxe: This allows you to mine stone and other hard materials. To make one, place two sticks vertically in the middle column of the crafting grid and three wood planks horizontally on the top row.
A wooden sword: This allows you to fight enemies and animals. To make one, place one stick vertically in the middle column of the crafting grid and two wood planks vertically on the top column.
A wooden axe: This allows you to chop wood faster. To make one, place two sticks vertically in the middle column of the crafting grid and three wood planks diagonally on the top left corner.
You can also make other tools like shovels and hoes, but they are not essential for now.

**Step 7: Find some food**

You will notice that you have a hunger bar below your health bar. This bar decreases over time as you do activities like running, jumping, mining, etc. If it reaches zero, you will start losing health and eventually die. To prevent this, you need to find some food and eat it.

There are different types of food in Minecraft, but the easiest ones to find are animals like cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, etc. You can kill them with your sword by left-clicking on them until they die. They will drop some meat that you can pick up by walking over it.

However, raw meat is not very nutritious and can sometimes make you sick. To cook it, you need to make a furnace.

**Step 8: With your sense of style!**

In Minecraft, you can play freely.
